## Projects

### Six-Cell Battery Management System (BMS) PCBA

Six-cell voltage measurement, passive balancing, coulomb-counting SOC modelling, UV/OV protection, and bidirectional charge/discharge switching. Designed after self-studying BMS principles.

### Micro Tunnel Boring Machine (MTBM)

Developed during my time on Penn Hyperloop. Half-meter diameter tunnel boring machine that uses a 10kW AC induction motor to torque a two-inch thick steel cutterhead, and a 15kW AC induction motor to generate over 60,000lbs of propulsion force.

### 1300W Electronic Speed Controller

ESC to drive a 1300W, 36A Brushless DC Motor (BLDC). It utilizes a three-phase MOSFET inverter, ATMEGA328P microcontroller, FOC implementation, and USB to serial UART translation for programming and bootloading.

### Autonomous Quadcopter

3D-printed quadcopter for autonomous navigation testing. It uses an Arduino Uno for low-level motor control commands, and an Nvidia Jetson Nano for high-level navigation and communication functionality.
