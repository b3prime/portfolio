## Projects
### 1300W Electronic Speed Controller

Developed as part of an electric skateboard personal project, this is an ESC to drive a 1300W, 36A BLDC. It utilizes a three-phase MOSFET inverter, ATMEGA328P commutation, FOC implementation, and USB to serial UART translation.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
